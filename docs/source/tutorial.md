# Tutorial

`deduce` is a rule-based de-identification method for clinical text written in Dutch, which finds and removes information in one or more categories of interest (e.g. person names, names of institutions, locations). In principle, `deduce` can work 'out of the box', however, based on both scientific research and personal experience, `deduce` is unlikely to remove all sensitive information when no effort goes into some customization. This tutorial should help you reach that goal. Along with basic steps to get started and highlights of some features, further in this tutorial, we describe how to tailor `deduce` to your specific data. 

It's useful to note that from version `2.0.0`, `deduce` is built using `docdeid`([docs](https://docdeid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [GitHub](https://github.com/vmenger/docdeid)), a small framework that helps build de-identifiers. Before you start customizing `deduce`, checking the `docdeid` docs will probably make it easier still.  

In case you get stuck with applying or modifying `deduce`, its always possible to ask for help, by creating an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/vmenger/deduce/issues)!

## Included components

A `docdeid` de-identifier is made up of document processors, such as annotators, annotation processors, and redactors, that are applied sequentially in a pipeline. The most important components that make up `deduce` are described below.

### Annotators

The `Annotator` is responsible for tagging pieces of information in the text as sensitive information that needs to be removed. `deduce` includes various annotators, described below:

| Group           | Annotator Name       | Annotator Type                              | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It's possible to add, remove, apply subsets, or to implement custom annotators, those options are described further down under [customizing `deduce`](#customizing-deduce). 

### Other processors

In addition to annotators, a `docdeid` de-identifier contains annotation processors, which do some operation to the set of annotations generated previously, and redactors, which take the annotation and replace them in the text. Other processors included in `deduce` are listed below:

| **Name**                    | **Group**       | **Description**                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Lookup sets

In order to match tokens to known identifiable words or concepts, `deduce` has the following builtin lookup sets:

| **Name**               | **Size** | **Examples**                                                                           |

## Customizing deduce

We highly recommend making some effort to customize `deduce`, as even some basic effort will almost surely increase accuracy. Below are outlined some ways to achieve this, including: making changes to the config, adding/removing custom pipeline components, and modifying the builtin lookup sets.

### Adding a custom config 

A default `base_config.json` ([source on GitHub](https://github.com/vmenger/deduce/blob/main/base_config.json)) file is packaged with `deduce`. Among with some basic settings, it defines all annotators (also listed above). Override settings, by providing an additional user config to Deduce, either as a file or as a dict: 

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce(config='my_own_config.json')
deduce = Deduce(config={'redactor_open_char': '**', 'redactor_close_char': '**'})
```

This will only override settings that are explicitly set in the user config, all other settings are kept as is. If you want to add or delete annotators (e.g. changing regular expressions), it's easiest to make a copy of `base_config.json`, and load it as follows: 

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce(load_base_config=False, config='my_own_config.json')
```

Note that you will now miss out on any updates to the base config that are packaged with new versions of Deduce. For that reason, a better way to add/remove processors is to [interact with `Deduce.processors` directly](#implementing-custom-components) after creating the model.

### Using `disabled` keyword to disable components

It's possible to disable specific (groups of) annotators or processors when deidentifying a text. For example, to apply all annotators, except those in the identifiers group: 

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce()
deduce.deidentify(text, disabled={'identifiers'})
```

Or, to disable one specific date annotator in the dates group, but keeping the other date patterns:

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce()
deduce.deidentify("text", disabled={'date_dmy_1'})
```

### Using `enabled` keyword

Although it's also possible to _enable_ only some processors, this is only useful in a limited amount of cases. You must manually specify the groups, individual annotators, and postprocessors to have a sensible output. For example, to de-identify only e-mail addresses, use:

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce()
deduce.deidentify("text", enabled={
    'email-addresses', # annotator group, with annotators:
    'email', 
    'post_processing', # post processing group, with processors:
    'overlap_resolver',
    'merge_adjacent_annotations',
    'redactor'
})
```

The following example however will apply **no annotators**, as the `email` annotator is enabled, but its' group `email-addresses` is not: 

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce()
deduce.deidentify("text", enabled={'email'})
```

### Implementing custom components

It's possible to implement the following custom components,  `Annotator`, `AnnotationProcessor`, `Redactor` and `Tokenizer`. This is done by implementing the abstract classes defined in the `docdeid` package, which is described here: [docdeid docs - docdeid components](https://docdeid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#docdeid-components).

In our case, we can add or remove custom document processors by interacting with the `deduce.processors` attribute directly:

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce()

# remove date annotators
del deduce.processors['dates']

# add another annotator
deduce.processors.add_processor( 
    'some_new_category', 
    MyCustomAnnotator(), 
    position=0
) 
```

Note that by default, processors are applied in the order they are added to the pipeline. To prevent a new annotator being added after the `post_processing` group (meaning the annotations would not be redacted in the text), use the `position` keyword of the `add_processor` method, as in the example above.

#### Changing tokenizer

There might be a case where you want to add a custom annotator to `deduce` that requires its own tokenizing logic. Replacing the builtin tokenizer is not recommended, as builtin annotators depend on it, but it's possible to add more tokenizers as follows:

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce()
deduce.tokenizers['my_custom_tokenizer'] = MyCustomTokenizer() # make sure this implements abstract docdeid.tokenize.Tokenizer
```

Then annotators can use:

```python
import docdeid as dd

def annotate(doc: dd.Document):
    tokens = doc.get_tokens("my_custom_tokenizer")
```

### Tailoring lookup structures

Updating the builtin lookup sets and tries is a very useful and straightforward way to tailor `deduce`. Changes can be made directly from the `Deduce.lookup_structs` attribute, as such: 

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce()

# sets
deduce.lookup_structs['first_names'].add_items_from_iterable(["naam", "andere_naam"])
deduce.lookup_structs['whitelist'].add_items_from_iterable(["woord", "ander_woord"])

# tries
deduce.lookup_structs['residences'].add_items(["kleine", "plaats", "in", "de", "regio"])
deduce.lookup_structs['institutions'].add_items_from_iterable(["verzorgingstehuis", "hier", "om", "de", "hoek"])

```

Full documentation on sets and tries, and how to modify them, is available in the [docdeid API](https://docdeid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/docdeid.ds.html#docdeid.ds.lookup.LookupSet).

Larger changes may also be made by copying the source files and modifying them directly, by pointing `deduce` to the directory with modified sources:

```python
from deduce import Deduce

deduce = Deduce(lookup_data_path="/my/path")
```

It's important to copy the directory, or your changes will be overwritten with the next `deduce` update. Currently, there is no additional documentation available on how to structure and transform the lookup items in the directory, other than inspecting the pre-packaged files. Also remember that any updates to lookup values in next releases of Deduce will not be applied if `deduce` loads items from a copy, differences need to be tracked manually with each release.
