and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 3.0.2 (2023-02-15)

### Changed
- recognize 4+ spaces as a token, blocking annotations

## 3.0.1 (2023-12-20)

### Fixed
- a bug with packaging `base_config.json`

## 3.0.0 (2023-12-20)

### Added
- speed optimizations, ~250%
- pseudo-annotating eponymous diseases (e.g. Creutzfeldt-Jakob)
- `PatientNameAnnotator`, which replaces `deduce.pattern`
- a structured way for loading and building lookup structures (lists and tries), including caching
- `pre_match_words` for some regexp annotators, speeding up the annotating
- option to present a user config as dict (using `config` keyword)

### Changed
- speedup for `TokenPatternAnnotator`
- some internals of `ContextPatternAnnotator`
- initials now detected by lookup list, rather than pattern
- redactor open and close chars from `<` `>` to `[` `]`, as previous chars caused issues in html (so deidentified text now shows `[PATIENT]`, `[LOCATIE]`, etc.)
- names of lookup structures to singular (`prefix`, rather than `prefixes`)
- `INSTELLING` tag to `ZIEKENHUIS` and `ZORGINSTELLING`
- refactored and simplified annotator loading, specifically the `annotator_type` config keyword now accepts references to classes (e.g `deduce.annotator.TokenPatternAnnotator`)
- renamed `interfix_with_capital` annotator to `interfix_with_name` 

### Deprecated
- the `config_file` keyword, now replaced by `config` which accepts both filenames and dicts
- old lookup list names, e.g. `prefixes` now replaced by `prefix`
- annotator types `custom`, `regexp`, `token_pattern`, `dd_token_pattern` and `annotation_context`, all replaced by setting class directly as `annotator_type` 
- everything in `deduce.pattern`, patient patterns now replaced by `PatientNameAnnotator`

### Removed
- automated coverage reporting on coveralls.io
- options `lowercase_lookup`, `lowercase_neg_lookup` for token patterns
- `utils.any_in_text` 

### Fixed
- some small additions/removals for specific lookup lists
- smaller bugs related to overlapping matches

## 2.5.0 (2023-11-28)

### Added
- the `RegexpPseudoAnnotator` component for filtering regexp matches based on preceding/following words
- a `prefix_with_interfix` pattern for names, detecting e.g. `Dr. van Loon`

### Changed
- the age detection component, with improved logic and pseudo patterns
- annotations are no longer counted adjacent when separated by a comma
- streets are prioritized over names when merging overlapping annotations
- removed some false positives for postal codes ending in `gr` or `ie`
- extended the postbus pattern for `xx.xxx` format (old notation)
- some smaller optimizations and exceptions for institution, hospital, placename, residence, medical term, first name, and last name lookup lists

### Fixed
- a bug with `BsnAnnotator` with non-digit characters in regexp

## 2.4.2 (2023-11-22)

### Changed
- multi-token lookup for first- and last names, so multi token names are now detected
- some small lookup list additions

## 2.4.3 (2023-11-22)

### Changed
- extended list of medical terms

## 2.4.2 (2023-11-21)

### Changed
- name lookup list contents, extending names and adding more exceptions

## 2.4.1 (2023-11-15)

### Added
- detection of initials `Ch.`, `Chr.`, `Ph.` and `Th.` 

## 2.4.0 (2023-11-15)

### Added
- logic for detecting hospitals, with added whitelist and separate annotator

### Changed
- logic for detecting (non-hospital) institutions, with extended lookup list

### Removed
- the separate Altrecht annotator, now included in the lookup list

## 2.3.1 (2023-11-01)

### Fixed
- include data files recursively in package

## 2.3.0 (2023-10-25)

### Added
- lookup lists (and logic) for Dutch provinces, regions, municipalities and streets

### Changed
- name of `residences` annotator to `placenames`, now includes provinces, regions and municipalities
- lookup lists (and logic) for residences
- logic for streets, housenumber and housenumber letters

## 2.2.0 (2023-09-28)

### Changed
- tokenizer logic: 
  - a token is now a sequence of alphanumeric characters, a single newline, or a single special character. 
  - whitespaces are no longer considered tokens
- moved token pattern logic to config, using a new `TokenPatternAnnotator`
- moved context pattern logic to config, using a new `ContextAnnotator`
- many updates to name detection logic
  - lookup list optimizations
  - added, removed and simplified patterns

## 2.1.0 (2023-08-07)

### Added
- a component for deidentifying BSN-nummers

### Changed
- updated dependencies
- by default, deduce now recognizes and tags bsn nummers
- by default, deduce now recognizes all other 7+ digit numbers as identifiers
- improved regular expressions for e-mail address and url matching, with separate tags
- logic for detecting phone numbers (improvements for hyphens, whitespaces, false positive identifiers)
- improved regular expression for age matching
- date detection logic:
  - now only recognizes combinations of day, month and year (day/month combinations caused many false positives)
  - detects year-month-day format in addition to (day-month-year)
- loading a custom config now only replaces the config options that are explicitly set, using defaults for those not included in the custom config

### Deprecated
- backwards compatibility, which was temporary added to transition from v1 to v2

### Removed
- a separate patient identifier tag, now superseded by a generic tag
- detection of day/month combinations for dates, as this caused many false positives (e.g. lab values, numeric scores) 

### Fixed
- annotations can no longer be counted as adjacent when separated by newline or tab (and will thus not be merged)

## 2.0.3 (2023-04-06)

### Fixed
- removed 'decibutus' from list of institutions as it caused many false positives

## 2.0.2 (2023-03-28)

### Changed
- upgraded dependencies, including `markdown-it-py` which had a vulnerability

## 2.0.1 (2022-12-09)

### Changed
- upgraded dependencies

## 2.0.0 (2022-12-05)

### Added
- introduced new interface for deidentification, using `Deduce()` class
- a separate documentation page, with tutorial and migration guide
- support for python 3.10 and 3.11

### Changed
- major refactor that touches pretty much every line of code
- use `docdeid` package for logic
- speedups: now 973% faster
- use lookup sets instead of lookup lists
- refactor tokenizer
- refactor annotators into separate classes, using structured annotations
- guidelines for contributing

### Removed
- the `annotate_text` and `deidentify_annotations` functions
- all in-text annotation (under the hood) and associated functions
- support for given names. given names can be added as another first name in the `Person` class. 
- support for python 3.7 and 3.8

### Fixed
- `<` and `>` are no longer replaced by `(` and `)` respectively
- deduce does not strip text (whitespaces, tabs at beginning/end of text) anymore

## 1.0.8 (2021-11-29)

### Added
- warn if there are any structured annotations whose annotated text does not match the original text in the span denoted by the structured annotation

### Fixed
- various modifications related to adding or subtracting spaces in annotated texts
- remove the lowercasing of institutions' names
- therefore, all structured annotations have texts matching the original text in the same span
